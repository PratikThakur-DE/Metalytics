Metalytics (Precious Metals Trading Data Pipeline)

1. Setup Development Environment
- Objective: Prepare a clean environment for development.

- Tasks:
    - Create a virtual environment.
    - Install necessary packages (SQLAlchemy, psycopg2, python-dotenv).
    - Set up a version control system (Git).

2. Database Design
    - Objective: Design and implement a relational database schema.

    - Tasks:
        - Choose PostgreSQL as the RDBMS.
        - Create the following tables:
        - precious_metals_prices: To store historical prices.
            Columns: id, metal, price, timestamp
            latest_12_hour_prices (view): To provide a view for model training using only the last 12 hours of data.
        - Set up database connection using SQLAlchemy.

3. Environment Configuration
    - Objective: Store database credentials securely.
    - Tasks:
        - Create a .env file for environment variables.
        - Implement a method to load these variables using python-dotenv.

4. Implement Database Connection Logic
    - Objective: Ensure robust database connection handling.
    - Tasks:
        - Create a db_connection.py file with SQLAlchemy engine configuration.
        - Implement a function to initialize the database and create tables.

5. Define Data Models
    - Objective: Create data models for database interaction.
    - Tasks:
        - Create a models.py file defining the PreciousMetalPrice class using SQLAlchemy ORM.
        - Ensure that all models inherit from the declarative base.

6. Develop Data Ingestion Pipeline
    - Objective: Fetch live prices for precious metals and populate the database.
    - Tasks:
        - Research APIs (e.g., Metals-API, api.metals.live).
        - Write a function to fetch data from the chosen API.
        - Insert the fetched data into the precious_metals_prices table.

7. Implement Machine Learning Model
    - Objective: Prepare to develop machine learning models for prediction.
    -   Tasks:
        - Modify the existing Model class to incorporate real data from the database.
        - Define a training method that utilizes data from the last 12 hours.

8. Testing and Validation
    - Objective: Ensure all components are functioning as expected.
    - Tasks:
        -Write unit tests for the database connection, models, and data ingestion.
        -Validate the ML model with test data.

9. Set Up Backups and Historical Data Retention
    - Objective: Ensure data safety and availability for analytical purposes.
    - Tasks:
        - Implement a backup solution for the database.
        - Set up a system for retaining historical data.

10. Containerization and Deployment
    - Objective: Prepare the application for production.
    - Tasks:
        - Create Docker images for the application and database.
        - Document deployment instructions.

11. Documentation
    - Objective: Create comprehensive documentation for the project.
    Tasks:
        - Write a README file covering setup, usage, and API documentation.
        - Include examples and explanations for the machine learning models.
